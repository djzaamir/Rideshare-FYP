1) Currently i have decided that a User will be able to do both
   a) Getting a Ride
   b) Sharing a Ride

   Initially when a user signup they would have to provide general details
   But later on if they decide to Share their Ride with others, they would have to complete
   another small signup which will include details about their Vehicle and other imp stuff

2) Currently i am dropping DOB attribute, it can be easily added later
