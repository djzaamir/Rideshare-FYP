1) Currently i have decided that a User will be able to do both
   a) Getting a Ride
   b) Sharing a Ride

   Initially when a user signup they would have to provide general details
   But later on if they decide to Share their Ride with others, they would have to complete
   another small signup which will include details about their Vehicle and other imp stuff

2) Currently i am dropping DOB attribute, it can be easily added later

3) Huge hiccup during the development, So i was at this point where i had to integrate
   Drawerlayout inside my application, and i was not able to share a single Drawerlayout with
   multiple activities.
   And i started to go with other useless approaches for example, creating Drawerlayout for
   every single activity in my application
   A) Not good
   B) Redundant code
   c) Not maintable
   D) wasted alot of my time

   In the I had to back to drawing board, and learn how to properly share a single DrawerLayout
   with multiple activities

   All of it resulted in setbacks, both code wise and time wise
